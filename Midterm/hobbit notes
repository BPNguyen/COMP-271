Not all text files have items for all letters of alphabet
Up to programmer discretion on how to handle that

Maybe combine two items in respective file with hyphen?
E.g. First name = "Isaac"
    File doesn't have item starting with an "I"
    Randomly choose two items in file and combine with hyphen
    Output: "Lemongrass-Orange"
