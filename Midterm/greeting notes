Example output:

*SIMULATION STARTS*
(Similar to CarWash)

Leo says hello to Brian

Brian says hello to Jack

* No response from Jack *

ERROR: Jack's mic is muted

Jack unmutes mic

Jack apologizes for mistake

Jack says hello to JJ

JJ says hello to ...

... Larissa (last person) says hello to Leo

*SIMULATION ENDS*
(Simlation always ends in a success with errors along the way, but errors are mitigated)

Use of cases?
Increase timestamps of errors?
